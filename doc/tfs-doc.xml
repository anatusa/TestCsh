      <para>TFS supports silent installation. To perform a silent installation
      the @APPNAME@-@VERSION@-@RELEASE@.silent.properties file must be in the
      same directory of your installation file. The following lists the
      properties which can be set.</para>

      <programlisting>
# Where to install @APPFULLNAME@ (default value is C:\Program Files\@APPNAME@-@VERSION@-@RELEASE@

startup.menu.name=@APPFULLNAME@ @VERSION@-@RELEASE@
# Create start menu entry (on/off)
create.start.menu.entry=on</programlisting>

      <para>Use the following command at the installation directory to do
      silent uninstallation.</para>

      <para>As you can see, Soundex (SQL2008) returned the same code for
      Brighton and Bristol, while at the same time it returned a different
      code for Loyds and LLoyds. Such results make you think twice before
      employing this function in a production environment. So, is this all
      that is available to us? Of course not.</para>

        strings <emphasis role="bold">10011010</emphasis> and <emphasis
        role="bold">10001101</emphasis> has a hamming distance of 4bits, (as
        four bits are dissimilar). The simple bitwise version can be simply
        calculated from the following C code.</para>

//given input 
unsigned int bitstring1; 
unsigned int bitstring2; 

//bitwise XOR (bitstring1 is destroyed)

        <title>Levenshtein Distance</title>

        <para>This is the basic edit distance function whereby the distance is

        into string2. Edit Operations are listed as follows:</para>

D(i-1,j-1) + d(si,tj) //subst/copy
D(i,j) = min D(i-1,j)+1 //insert 
D(i,j-1)+1 //delete</programlisting>

            <para>d(i,j) is a function whereby d(c,d)=0 if c=d, 1 else</para>

            <para>There are many extensions to the Levenshtein distance
            function typically these alter the d(i,j) function, but further
            extensions can be made for instance, the <link

            xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Needleman-Wunch
            distance</link> for which Levenshtein is equivalent if the gap
            distance is 1. The Levenshtein distance is calculated below for
            the term "sam chapman" and "sam john chapman", the final distance
            is given by the bottom right cell, i.e. 5. This score indicates
            that only 5 edit cost operations are required to match the strings
            (for example, insertion of the "john " characters, although a
            number of other routes can be traversed instead).</para>

        <title>Needleman-Wunch distance or Sellers Algorithm</title>

        <para>This approach is known by various names, Needleman-Wunch,
        Needleman-Wunch-Sellers, Sellers and the Improving Sellers algorithm.
        This is similar to the basic edit distance metric, <link
        xlink:href="http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/S.Chapman/stringmetrics.html#Levenshtein"
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Levenshtein
        distance</link>, this adds a variable cost adjustment to the cost of a
        gap, i.e. insert/deletion, in the distance metric. So the Levenshtein
        distance can simply be seen as the Needleman-Wunch distance with
        G=1.</para>

        <programlisting>
D(i-1,j-1) + d(si,tj) //subst/copy
D(i,j) = min D(i-1,j)+G //insert
D(i,j-1)+G //delete</programlisting>

        <para>Where G = "gap cost" and d(c,d) is again an arbitrary distance
        function on characters (e.g. related to typographic frequencies, amino
        acid substitutibility, etc). The Needleman-Wunch distance is calulated
        below for the term "sam chapman" and "sam john chapman", with the gap
        cost G set to 2. The final distance is given by the bottom right cell,
        i.e. 10. This score indicates that only 10 edit cost operations are
        required to match the strings (for example, insertion of the "john "
        characters, although a number of other routes can be traversed
        instead).</para>

        between related DNA and protein sequences. This has two main
        adjustable parameters a function for an alphabet mapping to cost
        values for substitutions and costs, (the d function). This also allows
        costs to be attributed to a gap G, (insert or delete). The final
        similarity distance is computed from the maximum value in the path
        where</para>

with the gap cost G set to 0.5 and where d(c,c) = -2, d(b,c) = 1.</programlisting>

        <para>The final distance is given by the highest valued cell, i.e. 6.

        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Jaro distance

        modifies the weights of poorly matching pair <emphasis>s, t</emphasis>
        that share a common prefix. The output score is simply adjusted as
        follows,</para>

        <para/>

        <para><emphasis>JaroWinklerScore(s,t) = JaroScore(s,t) +
        (prefixLength* PREFIXSCALE * (1.0f -
        JaroScore(s,t)));</emphasis></para>

        <para/>

        <para>Where <emphasis>prefixLength </emphasis>is the length of common
        prefix at the start of the string,</para>

        <para><emphasis>PREFIXSCALE</emphasis> is a constant scaling factor
        for how much the score is adjusted upwards for having common
        prefixes.</para>

        <para>This adjustment gives more favorable ratings to strings that
        match from the beginning for a set prefix length.</para>

        <title>Cosine similarity</title>

        <para>Cosine similarity is a common vector based similarity measure
        similar to <link
        xlink:href="http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/S.Chapman/stringmetrics.html#dice"
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">dice coefficient</link>.
        Whereby the input string is transformed into vector space so that the
        Euclidean cosine rule can be used to determine similarity. The cosine
        similarity is often paired with other approaches to limit the
        dimensionality of the problem. For instance with simple strings at
        list of stopwords are used to exclude from the dimensionality of the
        comparison. In theory this problem has as many dimensions as terms
        exist.</para>

        <title>Q-gram</title>

        <para>Q-grams are typically used in approximate string matching by
        "sliding" a window of length q over the characters of a string to
        create a number of 'q' length grams for matching a match is then rated
        as number of q-gram matches within the second string over possible
        q-grams.</para>

        <para>The intuition behind the use of q-grams as a foundation for
        approximate string processing is that when two strings s1 and s2 are
        within a small edit distance of each other, they share a large number
        of q-grams in common.</para>

        <para>Consider the following example. The positional q-grams of length
        q=3 for string "sam chapman" are f(1,##s), (2,#sa), (3,sam), (4,am ),
        (5,m c), (6, ch), (7,cha), (8,hap), (9,apm), (10,pma), (11,man),
        (12,an%), (13,n%%),  where '#' and '%' indicate the beginning and end
        of the string. So getting the q-grams for two query strings allows the
        count of identical q-grams over the total q-grams available. this
        method is frequently employed as a 'fuzzy' search in databases to
        allow non exact matching of queries. A rating is also often given by
        the ratio of the q-grams distance metric.</para>

        <para>For a wider discussion on q-gram and adding them to database
        applications see the following paper:</para>

        <title>Block Distance or L1 distance or City Block distance</title>

        <para>This distance metric is variously named as block distance, L1
        distance or city block distan</para>

        <para>This is a vector based approach so where 'q' and 'r' are defined
        in n-dimensional vector space The L1 or block distance is calculated
        from summing the edge distances.</para>

        <para>This can be described in two dimensions with discrete-valued
        vectors, when we can picture the set of points within a grid, the
        distance value is simply the number of edges between points that must
        be traversed to get from 'q' to 'r' within the grid. This is the same
        problem as getting from corner a to b in a rectilinear street map,
        hence the name "city-block metric".</para>

        <title>Dice’s Coefficient</title>

        <para>Dice coefficient is a term based similarity measure (0-1)
        whereby the similarity measure is defined as twice the number of terms
        common to compared entities divided by the total number of terms in
        both tested entities. The Coefficient result of 1 indicates identical
        vectors as where a 0 equals orthogonal vectors.</para>

        String1 + Number of terms in String2)</para>

        coefficient</title>

        <para>This is another token based vector space similarity measure like

        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">the matching
        coefficient</link>. Jaccard Similarity uses word sets from the
        comparison instances to evaluate similarity. The jaccard similarity
        penalizes a small number of shared entries ( as a portion of all
        non-zero entries) more than the <link

        Jaccard similarity is frequently used as a similarity measure for
        chemical compounds. This similarity measure was first details in 1912
        in the following paper.</para>

        <para>Jaccard 1912, "The distribution of the flora of the alpine
        zone", New Phytologist 11:37-50</para>

        <para>Each instance is represented as a Jaccard vector similarity
        function. The Jaccard between two vectors X and Y is</para>

        <para>(X*Y) / (|X||Y|-(X*Y))</para>

        <para/>

        <para>where (X*Y) is the inner product of X and Y, and |X| =
        (X*X)^1/2, i.e. the Euclidean norm of X.</para>

        <para>This can more easily be described as ( |X &amp; Y| ) / ( | X or
        Y | ).</para>

        <para>This approach has been extended by a number of
        specializations/alterations not considered here.</para>

        <para>The Matching Coefficient is a very simple vector based approach
        which simply counts the number of terms, (dimensions), on which both
        vectors are non zero. So for vector set X and set Y the matching
        coefficient is |X &amp; Y|. This can be seen as the vector based count
        of coreferent terms. This is similar to the vector version of the

        <para>The Monge Elkan approach makes other additional tests by taking
        the semantic similarity of a number of fields or sub fields into

      <title>Evaluating metric accuracy and comparing Metrics</title>

      <para>All string metric functions accept two string arguments and return
      a float value between 0 and 1. The closer the score reaches 1 means that
      the metric we have applied is telling us the 2 input strings are
      matches.</para>

      <para>Now that we have plenty of Metrics to choose from, we will want to
      evaluate them and see which one is best for us. This is where the
      following function comes in handy:</para>

      <para><programlisting>CREATE FUNCTION dbo.CompareStringMetrics(@firstword [nvarchar](255), 
@secondword [nvarchar](255))
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
(
SELECT dbo.Jaro(@firstword, @secondword) as Score, 'Jaro' as Metric
UNION SELECT dbo.JaroWinkler(@firstword, @secondword), 'JaroWinkler'
UNION SELECT dbo.BlockDistance(@firstword, @secondword), 'BlockDistance'
UNION SELECT dbo.ChapmanLengthDeviation(@firstword, @secondword),
'ChapmanLengthDeviation'
UNION SELECT dbo.ChapmanMeanLength(@firstword, @secondword), 'ChapmanMeanLength'
UNION SELECT dbo.CosineSimilarity(@firstword, @secondword), 'CosineSimilarity'
UNION SELECT dbo.DiceSimilarity(@firstword, @secondword), 'DiceSimilarity'
UNION SELECT dbo.EuclideanDistance(@firstword, @secondword), 'EuclideanDistance'
UNION SELECT dbo.JaccardSimilarity(@firstword, @secondword), 'JaccardSimilarity'
UNION SELECT dbo.Levenstein(@firstword, @secondword), 'Levenstein'
UNION SELECT dbo.MatchingCoefficient(@firstword, @secondword),
'MatchingCoefficient'
UNION SELECT dbo.MongeElkan(@firstword, @secondword), 'MongeElkan'
UNION SELECT dbo.NeedlemanWunch(@firstword, @secondword), 'NeedlemanWunch'
UNION SELECT dbo.OverlapCoefficient(@firstword, @secondword),
'OverlapCoefficient'
UNION SELECT dbo.QGramsDistance(@firstword, @secondword), 'QGramsDistance'
UNION SELECT dbo.SmithWaterman(@firstword, @secondword),
'SmithWaterman'
UNION SELECT dbo.SmithWatermanGotoh(@firstword, @secondword),
'SmithWatermanGotoh'
UNION SELECT dbo.SmithWatermanGotohWindowedAffine(@firstword, @secondword),
'SmithWatermanGotohWindowedAffine'
)</programlisting></para>

      <para>This means that now we can easily evaluate the performance and the
      accuracy of each metric by running queries like: <programlisting>Select * from CompareStringMetrics('Loyds', 'LLoyds') where score &gt; 0.6
Select * from CompareStringMetrics('bristol', 'brighton') where score &lt; 0.5</programlisting></para>

      <title>Conclusion</title>

      <para>SimMetrics is a great library for fuzzy text comparisons. This
      article showed you how you can bring its power into Sql Server. There
      are plenty of functions to choose from, experiment and see what works
      best for you. You can be creative on what you want to apply your metric
      , e.g. instead of applying directly on a field you can choose to make
      simple search keys by lower casing fields, striping common text patterns
      that you don’t need (e.g. Inc, Ltd etc) and removing numbers. There are
      many ways to apply these sort of functions, what is more suitable for
      you is your call, since it depends on the context of your problem. If
      you find any innovative ways of correlating your data share it with
      us!</para>

      appropriate OS specific binary distributions.</para>

      <para>On Windows, to have the resulting '.exe' file automatically
      signed, the file called 'sign.build' should be placed in the root
      directory of the projects source with the following properties:</para>

      <programlisting>
sign.privatekey - absolute path to the private key used for signing.
sign.pwd        - password for signing.</programlisting>

      <para>Example of the 'sign.build' file:</para>

    <programlisting>                GNU Free Documentation License
                 Version 1.3, 3 November 2008


 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this 
License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or 
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.</programlisting>
